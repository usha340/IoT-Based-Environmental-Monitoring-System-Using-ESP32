# IoT-Based-Environmental-Monitoring-System-Using-ESP32
# Overview
This project presents a Weather Monitoring System using Blynk, designed to track real-time environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, and rainfall. The system utilizes IoT technology to provide instant weather updates via a mobile application.

# Methodology
The system integrates:

Hardware: 
Arduino Uno, ESP32-WROOM-32, DHT11 (temperature & humidity sensor), BMP180 (pressure sensor), MH-RD (rain sensor), and MQ-7 (CO sensor).
Software: 
Arduino IDE for programming and the Blynk app for data visualization.
The microcontroller collects sensor data, processes it, and transmits it wirelessly to the Blynk application, where users can monitor real-time weather updates.

# Working Principle
Sensors collect environmental data.
Arduino processes and sends data to the Blynk platform using ESP32 WiFi.
The Blynk mobile application displays the weather parameters in a user-friendly interface.
Features
✔️ Wireless monitoring via IoT
✔️ Real-time weather updates
✔️ Low power consumption
✔️ Easy-to-use Blynk mobile application

# Conclusion
This project successfully implements an IoT-based Weather Monitoring System, offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for weather tracking. It is beneficial for farmers, travelers, and urban planners who require real-time weather data.
